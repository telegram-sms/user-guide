# Privacy policy

You should be aware that using Telegram-SMS means you trust the way we handle your information. We fully understand that it is a significant responsibility, thus we work hard to protect your information and make sure you can take everything under control.

This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage your data.

## What We Collect

Based on the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and necessity, we will only collect the following information that is necessary for the purpose of achieving the product's functions.

We will collect the necessary data so that we can provide you and other users with better service. We will be able to know some basic information about you from the data collected (for example, the system language) and the crash information on your device.

## How We Collect

Data collection is optional. When we need some information from you, we would require you to provide them explicitly to the developer team, via Telegram, email or other means.

## How We Store and Protect Your Data

Your messages are sent directly to the API server owned by Telegram. This app does not forward messages to any other parties, and is unable to know what you sent.

We are strictly following the GDPR standards. If you are under 16 years old, you would be required to obtain your parents' or legal guardian's consent prior to using the software.

## Provide Data to Us

All of your information will be stored in your own personal device, and will not be uploaded to any other parties.

If we do need to diagnostic remotely, you can send `error.log` to us using email.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.

- If such changes result in a substantial impairment of your rights under this Privacy policy, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail and by reminding you at a prominent place on the webpage before the changes take effect.

- Under such circumstances, if you continue to use our services, you will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by the updated policy.
